    description: A skill-building and reference book for artists developing oral histories and interview-based projects. This workbook approaches the practice and application of oral narratives as a co-constructed creative endeavor rather than reparative ‘truth’ work. Resisting the idea that a recorded interview is a neutral historical document, this skill-building workbook instead shares perspectives on listening, remembering, gossiping, questioning, and framing, with the aim of telling our stories not as fixed subjects but as artists who are alive and breathing.

    description: Shape Your L.A. is an online civic engagement tool for residents of Los Angeles County. L.A. County is a behemoth, patchwork government system “overseeing” 10 million folks and 88 cities (not to mention large swathes of unincorporated areas). This app was made to help break down and navigate that system. Enter your address to learn more which power structures handle the issues that matter to you, and how to do things in your neighborhood. <br/> This project was created by a small team of cross-disciplinary journalists, data workers, designers, and developers in late 2023, and continues to be updated and maintained by the L.A. Times’ Data and Graphics Team. In January 2024, we made the app available in Spanish.
