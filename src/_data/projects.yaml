    description: A skill-building and reference book for artists developing oral histories and interview-based projects. This workbook approaches the practice and application of oral narratives as a co-constructed creative endeavor rather than reparative ‘truth’ work. Resisting the idea that a recorded interview is a neutral historical document, this skill-building workbook instead shares perspectives on listening, remembering, gossiping, questioning, and framing, with the aim of telling our stories not as fixed subjects but as artists who are alive and breathing.

  - title: Inverse Surveillance Project
    year: July 2022
    description: Inverse Surveillance Project is a multi-media art installation designed and produced by the Arab and Muslim American communities in the Chicagoland area. The installation was exhibited in Bridgeview, IL in the summer of 2022. It featured a life-sized labyrinth of archival projections which repurposed thousands of records collected from the decade of FBI surveillance over their community (a topic covered by Assia Boundaoui’s first documentary, <i>The Feeling of Being Watched</i>). During the length of the exhibition, the space was used as a community art studio where free embroidery, healing and organizing workshops were offered.
    collaborators: Assia Boundaoui, Nouha Boundaoui
    credits: 'Collaborating artists: Yucef Merhi and Shirin Anlen. Consulting partners and subject-matter experts: Dr. Kameelah Mu’Min Rashad & the Muslim Wellness Foundation, Wafa Ghanim & Tatreez and Tea, Jumana Qawasmi & Watan, and Katerina Cizek. This art project was co-created with the Arab and Muslim American communities in Chicago.'

    description: Shape Your L.A. is an online civic engagement tool for residents of Los Angeles County. L.A. County is a behemoth, patchwork government system “overseeing” 10 million folks and 88 cities (not to mention large swathes of unincorporated areas). This app was made to help break down and navigate that system. Enter your address to learn more which power structures handle the issues that matter to you, and how to do things in your neighborhood. <br/> This project was created by a small team of cross-disciplinary journalists, data workers, designers, and developers in late 2023, and continues to be updated and maintained by the L.A. Times’ Data and Graphics Team. In January 2024, we made the app available in Spanish.

    description: A reading and study group that gathers every Sunday evening. Focusing on critical theory and other texts with philosophical, legal and aesthetic concerns, CRG has discussed texts that range from mid-century, European investigations of the origins of Facism to works-in-progress about climate change as well as popular science fiction. Started by artists, activists, and scholars who were curious about the assumptions underlying the appeals to "community" so prevalent in organizing spaces, the group continues to foster space for anyone who wants to challenge their inherited ideas about common being and loves the exercise of close reading. In 2021, the first issue of Counter was released, featuring essays by reading group members on labor organizing and work.
