      <p>Nothing gets going on its own. Years ago, many projects were made for friend of a friend, <a href="https://hodakatebi.com/">Hoda Katebi</a>, a writer and organizer based in Chicago, including Blue Tin Production, a worker-owned apparel studio; Believers Bail Out, a Muslim bail-fund organization; and Because We’ve Read, an international book club focused on radical texts.</p>
      <p>Nowadays at a new project with long-time friends and collaborators, <a href="https://lacarchive.com" target="_blank">Los Angeles Contemporary Archive</a>, an art archive for contemporary art.</p>
      {# <p>There are a lot of things graphic design cannot do. There are a lot of things tech can’t solve.</p> #}
